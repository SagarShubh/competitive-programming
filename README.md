# competitive-programming
This repository contains my solutions for competitive programming contests that I participated in.
Sometimes I will write the contest result in the commit message so that I can remember and reminisce about my performance in the past contests.

You can freely use this repository on your own risk, e.g. for learning purpose or to see how awesome I am (just kidding :p).
I don't guarantee that every solutions here got verdict `Accepted`, sometimes I will write the verdict in the filename or the comment in the source code if the solution got a verdict other than `Accepted`.

If you are curious about my handles/usernames on various online judges, you can see my profile [here](https://clist.by/coder/wifi/).
